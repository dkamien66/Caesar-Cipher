encrypt.py

The encrypt.py file will use a random integer key to shift all of the letters of the plaintext in the example.txt file and produce the output in the coded_message.txt.

decrypt.py

The decrypt.py file will use brute force attacks to decrypt the ciphertext in coded_message.txt and produce the output in brute_force_decryptions.txt.

frequency_analysis.py

The frequency_analysis.py file will attempt to find what key was used to produce the encrypted ciphertext in the coded_message.txt file by analyzing the frequency of the letters.

Motivation for this came from https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/Cyber_p005/cybersecurity/crack-caesar-cipher
